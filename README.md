# Applied Analytics

This repository contains my lab projects from **STAT 223 – Applied Analytics** at Knox College.  
Each lab applies statistical and machine learning techniques using **R** and **Python** to explore, model, and interpret real-world data.  
The work demonstrates skills in data wrangling, visualization, regression, forecasting, classification, and clustering — connecting analytics theory to practical business and social insights.



### Overview
| Lab | Language | Topic | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **01** | R | Baseball Performance Analysis | Created a custom `MADfun()` function and explored MLB team statistics (1995–2021) using descriptive analysis and visualization. |
| **02** | Python | Baseball Regression Modeling | Used regression to analyze how batting averages, home runs, and slugging percentages affect team win rates. |
| **03** | Python | College Graduation Rate Analysis | Built multiple regression models to study how tuition, enrollment, and faculty ratio influence graduation outcomes. |
| **04** | Python | Democratic Vote Margin Modeling | Modeled vote margins using unemployment, PhD rates, and salary data; applied log, polynomial, and interaction effects. |
| **05** | Python | Elite Status & Alumni Donations | Used logistic and multiple regression to predict university prestige and alumni giving rates. |
| **06** | R | Time Series and Forecasting | Explored trend, seasonality, and forecasting with Beer, IBM, GDP, and Olympic datasets using exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. |
| **07** | R | Advanced Time Series (ARIMA & ETS) | Compared ARIMA and ETS forecasting models using Box-Cox transformations and residual diagnostics. |
| **08** | Python | kNN and Clustering (Iris Dataset) | Applied k-Nearest Neighbors and K-Means/Hierarchical clustering to classify and group Iris flower species. |
| **09** | Python | Association Rules & Decision Trees | Combined Market Basket Analysis and Decision Tree Classification to uncover relationships and improve model accuracy. |


### How to Run
1. Open any lab’s `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab** or the `.R` file in **RStudio**.  
2. Run all cells (or code chunks) to reproduce analyses and visualizations.  
3. Review the accompanying **PDF reports** for written interpretations, results, and conclusions.


### Tools & Libraries
**R:** RStudio, `ggplot2`, `forecast`, `fpp3`, `dplyr`  
**Python:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, mlxtend
