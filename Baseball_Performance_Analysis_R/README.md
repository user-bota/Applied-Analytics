### Baseball Performance Analysis in R

This lab explores Major League Baseball team performance from 1995–2021 using R. It introduces custom function creation, descriptive statistics, and visual analysis techniques.

**Key Insight:**  
A custom `MADfun()` function was written to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) with input validation.  
Using `MLBTeams.csv`, the analysis shows that:
- Team win percentages remained consistent across decades.  
- Home runs dipped mid-2000s but rose again after 2015.  
- Batting averages gradually declined, suggesting evolving offensive strategies and stronger pitching.  
- Divisional performance analysis revealed **AL East** and **AL West** as consistently top-performing divisions.

**How to Run:**  
1. Open the `.R` script in **RStudio**.
2. Load the `MLBTeams.csv` dataset.  
3. Run all code chunks to reproduce the tables, boxplots, and correlation visuals.

**Files Included:**  
- `STAT 223 Lab 1` - R code.  
- `STAT_223_Lab1.pdf` — full written report with results and interpretations.

**Tools:** R, RStudio, ggplot2, dplyr.
